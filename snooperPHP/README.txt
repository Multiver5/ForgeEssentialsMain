You can make your own connector or use the premade ForgeEssentialsQuery.class.php
The index.php is an example of how you should use the ForgeEssentialsQuery.
You need to make shure you include the "key.key"

The get funtion in ForgeEssentialsQuery has a feeld "data", that should be an array with at least 1 item called "id".
That "id" will determen what responce you will get. If a responce needs a username or extra data, it will tell you.

Make shure you change the IP and port before you start telling me it doens't work.
